In our study case, precision is when the algorithm guesses that a cell is malignant and actually measures how certain we are that this cell is a true malignant. For example, a precision of 0.9 means that if the model predicts 100 malignant cells, the 90 of them are malignant and the rest 10 are benign (false).\n",

The rest 20% of real malignant cells will not be found by the diagnosis based on this algorithm, something that is unacceptable.\n",

    "Train/test split has a lurking danger if the split isn't random and when one subset of our data has only observations from one class, i.e. our data are imbalanced. This will result in overfitting. To avoid this, cross validation is applied. There are several cross validation methods such as K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In K-Fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is the increased accuracy because all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original data comes in some sort of sorted shape, a shuffle of the order of the data points is necessary before splitting them up into folds. This can be done in `KFold()`, setting the `shuffle` parameter to `True`. If there are concerns about class imbalance, then the `StratifiedKFold()` class should be used instead. Where `KFold()` assigns points to folds without attention to output class, `StratifiedKFold()` assigns data points to folds so that each fold has approximately the same number of data points of each output class. This is most useful for when we have imbalanced numbers of data points in the outcome classes (e.g. one is rare compared to the others). For this class as well, it can be used `shuffle=True` to shuffle the data points' order before splitting into folds."

    "#### Putting it all together with GridSearchCV and Pipeline\n",
    "Algorithm tuning is a process in which we optimize the parameters that impact the model in order to enable the algorithm to perform with an improved performance. If we don't tune the algorithms well, performance will be poor with low accuracy, precision or recall. Most of the machine learning algorithms contain a set of parameters (hyperparameters), which should be set up adequately to perform the best. While all of the algorithms attempt to set reasonable default hyperparameters, they can often fail to provide optimal results for many real world datasets in practice. To find an optimized combination of hyperparameters, a metric is chosen to measure the algorithm's performance on an independent data set and hyperparameters that maximize this measure are adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning the models is a tedious, time-consuming process and there can sometimes be interactions between the choices we make in one step and the optimal value for a downstream step. Hopefully, there are two simple and easy tuning strategies, grid search and random search. Scikit-learn provides these two methods for algorithm parameter tuning. `GridSearchCV()` allows us to construct a grid of all the combinations of parameters passing one classifier to pipeline each time, tries each combination, and then reports back the best combination. So, instead of trying numerous values for each tuning parameter, `GridSearchCV()` will apply all the combinations of parameters - not just vary them independently - avoiding local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of `GridSearchCV()` is that it multiplies out all the combinations of parameters and tries each one, making a k-fold cross-validated model for each combination.
